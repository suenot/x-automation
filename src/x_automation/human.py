"""Input that leaves the trace a person leaves.

A page sees more than the value of a field. It sees which events arrived, in
what order, how far apart, and whether the browser marked them as
user-generated. Measured on a probe page that logs every event a form can
observe, entering the same 49-character text:

    locator.fill(text)     49 characters -> 1 beforeinput, 1 input, 0 keydown
    execCommand insertText 49 characters -> 1 input, no beforeinput, 0 keydown
    locator.type(delay=55) 49 keystrokes with 0-3 ms between keyup and keydown
    fabricated paste event isTrusted: false, clipboardData not a DataTransfer
    type_text(page, text)  49 keystrokes 42-186 ms apart, 258 mousemove samples
                           on the way to the field against 27 for a bare click

Nothing here fabricates an event: every event this module causes comes from
the browser and carries isTrusted: true.

Typing is not always the human answer either. Typing "a<palm emoji>b"
produced three input events but only two keydowns: a character outside ASCII
arrives without a keystroke. That is not a flaw to hide — it is exactly what
an emoji picker produces for a real person. So `enter_text` types the ASCII
runs and inserts the rest, which is the trace a person at this keyboard
leaves.

A real clipboard paste is a closer imitation still for a long caption: it
reaches a DraftJS editor's saved state exactly as typing does, and the page sees
`isTrusted: true` with a genuine `DataTransfer`, where a driver's
`insert_text` leaves `insertText` and no paste event at all — the same
signature as `fill`. It is off by default anyway, because the clipboard
belongs to whoever else is using the machine; see `paste`.
The measurements and the method behind them are written up in
`docs-site/@docs/guides/what-a-page-sees-when-we-type.md`. This file is kept
in step with the copies in the other publishers; they are standalone
repositories and do not share a package.
